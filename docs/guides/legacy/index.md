# Legacy API

Welcome to the documentation for the legacy ContentSettings API!

> [!WARNING]
> This API is deprecated and will not be updated. While it won't be
> removed for compatibility's sake, it is strongly recommended
> to use the new settings API instead as it is more stable and
> it's easier to use.
> See [here](../quickstart/getting-started.md) for how to use that API.
