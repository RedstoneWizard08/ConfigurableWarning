Welcome to our docs!

ConfigurableWarning is a mod for Content Warning that allows you to change
several aspects of the game that you can't normally change.
ConfigurableWarning also has a handy developer API which is documented right here!

API Docs:
<xref:ConfigurableWarning.API>

[Get Started](getting-started.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Looking for the old ContentSettings API?
> It's still available, but it's deprecated, and won't be getting updates.
> You can find it [here](../legacy/index.md).
